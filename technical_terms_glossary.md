### A glossary of technical terms that I encounter in my readings. I try to put each concept into simplified terms while keeping overall purpose clear (ex. explain the purpose of a transformer, not the math behind it). Hopefully these are helpful for others trying to understand these papers as well.


```priori```: information that is known before an experience starts. For example, environments that are "priori unknown" to a robot just means that the robot has not previously seen this environment.

```mobile manipulation```: simpler than it sounds. It just means functionality of being able to move around and manipulate objects (as opposed to static manipulation tasks, ex. purely table-top tasks).

```open vocabulary```: also simpler than it sounds. If a system has an open vocbulary, it isn't restricted to a small set of words. The system can generalize to reason about things it hasn't encountered before.
